NGINX Controller User Role
==========================

# This repository has been archived. There will likely be no further development on the project and security vulnerabilities may be unaddressed.

Manage custom user roles with NGINX Controller.
The user role is how permissions are assigned to users.  The user role defines the objects / endpoints within NGINX Controller that the user can interact with and what they can do with those objects.
NGINX Controller includes three built-in Roles that cannot be modified: admin, user, and guest.

Requirements
------------

[NGINX Controller](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-controller/)

Role Variables
--------------

### Required Variables

`controller.fqdn` - FQDN of the NGINX Controller instance

`controller.auth_token` - Authentication token for NGINX Controller

`nginx_controller_user_role.metadata.name` -  name of the Role

### Template Variables

This role has multiple template related variables. The descriptions and defaults for all these variables can be found in **[vars/main.yml](./vars/main.yml)**

Dependencies
------------

Example Playbook
----------------

To use this role you can create a playbook such as the following (let's name it `nginx_controller_user_role.yaml` for the purposes of this example).

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no

  vars:
    nginx_controller_user_email: "user@example.com" # Required by nginx_controller_generate_token role
    nginx_controller_user_password: "mySecurePassword" # Required by nginx_controller_generate_token role
    nginx_controller_fqdn: "controller.mydomain.com"
    nginx_controller_validate_certs: false

  tasks:
    - name: Retrieve the NGINX Controller auth token
      include_role:
        name: nginxinc.nginx_controller_generate_token

    - name: Configure the user role
      include_role:
        name: nginxinc.nginx_controller_user_role
      vars:
        nginx_controller_user_role:
          metadata:
            name:  # the name of the user role
            displayName:   # a friendly display name for the user role (spaces and special characters allowed)
            description:  # a description of the user role
            tags:   # an array of tags
              - tagOne
              - tagTwo
          desiredState:
            permissions:  # an array of endpoints, objects, and the level of access
              - access: "READ"
                path: "/services/environments/development"
              - access: "WRITE"
                path: "/services/environments/test"
```

You can then run `ansible-playbook nginx_controller_user_role.yaml` to execute the playbook.

Alternatively, you can also pass/override any variables at run time using the `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag like so `ansible-playbook nginx_controller_user_role.yaml -e "nginx_controller_user_email=user@company.com nginx_controller_user_password=notsecure nginx_controller_fqdn=controller.example.local nginx_controller_validate_certs=false"`

You can also pass/override any variables by passing a `yaml` file containing any number of variables like so `ansible-playbook nginx_controller_user_role.yaml -e "@nginx_controller_user_role_vars.yaml"`
